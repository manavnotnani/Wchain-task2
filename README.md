# Decentralized Exchange Liquidity System

A robust implementation of an automated liquidity management system for decentralized token exchanges, featuring real-time rate calculations and efficient token swapping mechanisms.

## Core Components

### LiquidityManager Contract

The primary contract handling all liquidity-related operations in a decentralized manner. This contract serves as the backbone of the exchange system, managing token pairs and their respective liquidity pools.

#### Key Features:
- Dynamic liquidity provision and withdrawal
- Automated token swap execution
- Real-time exchange rate calculations
- Liquidity pool balance monitoring
- Safety checks and validation systems

#### Main Operations:

```solidity
function provideLiquidity(address tokenAddress, uint256 tokenAmount) external
function withdrawLiquidity(address tokenAddress, uint256 tokenAmount) external
function executeSwap(address sourceToken, address targetToken, uint256 amount) external
function fetchExchangeRate(address sourceToken, address targetToken) external view returns (uint256)
function checkPoolLiquidity(address tokenAddress) external view returns (uint256)
```

### TokenInterface Contract

A standardized token interface implementation used for testing and development purposes. Built on the ERC20 standard with customizable decimal support.

#### Configuration:

The contract initializes with three core parameters:
```solidity
constructor(
    string memory tokenName,
    string memory tokenSymbol,
    uint8 decimalPlaces
)
```

#### Features:
- Configurable decimal precision
- Standard ERC20 compliance
- Built-in safety mechanisms
- Transparent supply management

## Development Guidelines

### Environment Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Compile contracts:
```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

### Testing Framework

Execute test suites using:
```bash
# Standard test execution
npx hardhat test

# With gas reporting
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test

# Start local node
npx hardhat node

# Deploy using Ignition
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/LiquidityModule.ts
```

## Technical Specifications

- Smart contract architecture follows Ethereum standards
- Gas-optimized operations for cost-effective transactions
- Comprehensive testing suite for all core functionalities
- Modular design for easy upgrades and maintenance
